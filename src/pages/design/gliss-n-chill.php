            Gliss n Chill was developed during a workshop called "Movement and Sounds." 
            The goal of this project was to create an immersive experience that reacts to movement and sound.

                Gliss n Chill places you in a serene forest environment surrounded by seven wisteria flowers. 
                Using body movement, you can interact with these flowers to create music. 
                Moving your right hand triggers different notes, with each flower representing a note in a Pentatonic scale, 
                allowing you to compose unique melodies through movement.

                The project is built using Mediapipe for real-time hand tracking, Matter.js for realistic physics simulation, 
                and Vite for fast development. The structure and styling are handled with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
