        <p class="article-title__second">In fall 2023, I designed the fictional UI of a dating app called DUO. This work
            was done in collaboration with my
            friend and classmate <a href="https://clairelanao.framer.website/" target="_blank">Claire Lanao</a>.</p>

            <p class="article-section__para">In December 2023, a cinema school student named Hadrien Corsie sent a
                message on the WhatsApp group in which all Gobelins Paris students are. He was looking for one or more
                students to design a fictional dating app for a music clip he was producing. We thought that it could
                be a nice opportunity to practice UI design and to network.

            <h5 class="article-section__title">The brief</h5>
            <p class="article-section__para">After accepting the tender, Hadrien sent us a brief with all the
                explanations about the project (synopsis, ideas, and the most important: a mood board with a color
                pallette). Here is the sequence for which we need to design the app:
                <br>
                <br>
                "Zo√© is on her bed scrolling through her
                phone. She receives a notification.
                She opens the dating app.
                She hesitates to swipe right or
                or left. We project ourselves into the
                phone."
